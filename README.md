Description of game:<br>
This game is not my idea it was inspired by many flash games with the same concept except most of them have the words moving from top to bottom where mine moves from right to left<br>

Before running the game make sure the following is installed:<br>
-pygame ( pip install pygame ) <br>
-nltk ( pip install nltk ) https://www.nltk.org/install.html<br>
-install all the fonts provided in assets folder (NOT REQUIRED, but incase anything happens)<br>

How to play:<br>
-choose the length of letter that will be generated from the options (can be multiple choices simultaiously) from 2 to 8 <br>
-press play<br>
-gameplay:<br>
-when words start to appear type in your words<br>
-if your typed word matches the generated word, it will be highlighted green, press enter to make the word disappear <br>
-If you fail to make a word disappear before it goes outside the screen, you will lose a life <br>
-as the level increases te number of words will be added (level 2 = 2 words, level 3 = 3 words, etc.) and words will move faster<br>
